## Open Source
Our dedication to open source will be the most important piece of this project. There are plenty of individual tool developers and more the biggest inspiration for this particular community is [ProjectDiscovery](https://github.com/projectdiscovery). The goal ultimately is to garner a community that enjoys developing tooling and works together to make a community that is welcoming and allows for creativity. With that said, if somebody needs help or is requesting help with the issue that they're taking on, please help them learn!
